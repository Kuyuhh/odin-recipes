        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Okay, if you're here after reading my fried rice recipe, you know that I mentioned that I will eat that with chicken breast as a post workout meal. I'm gonna show you how to make that now so you can have a filling, high protein meal. :)</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken Breast (4 oz. at the minimum)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Garlic Powder</li>
            <li>Any other spices you might want to try</li>
            <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make sure your chicken breast is an even thickness throughout so it cooks evenly. If it's not, smash that thing down with a tenderizer or a frying pan.</li>
            <li>Season up your chicken with the salt, pepper and garlic powder.</li>
            <li>Heat up a pan to medium/medium-low heat. Once it's hot, lay your chicken flat in the pan.</li>
            <li>Let it cook for about 5-8 minutes both sides. If you have a cooking thermometer (you should), the chicken's internal temperature should be 165 degrees fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from pan. Let it rest for a few minutes then slice it up. Or don't if you just wanna eat it like a chicken strip or whatever.</li>
            <li>And you are good to go! Serve it up with a side of your choice or just eat it by itself and enjoy! <3 </li>
        </ol>
