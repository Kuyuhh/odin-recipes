    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Alright, so this is gonna be a super simple egg fried rice recipe. This is literally what I cook up real quick for a post workout meal with some chicken breast. Lemme show you how to make it okay?</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup white rice</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>low sodium soy sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Crack your eggs into a bowl and beat em up. Get them nice and mixed.</li>
        <li>Heat your pan up to medium heat, add vegetable oil.</li>
        <li>Once the pan's nice and hot, add your rice (typically gonna want to use day old rice, but if you only have rice that you just made today it'll do.)</li>
        <li>Immediately add your beaten eggs and stir them into the rice, get it nice and mixed together.</li>
        <li>Add soy sauce to rice, just eyeball it. You want your rice to look brown-ish.</li>
        <li>Lastly, drizzle your little bit of sesame oil over the rice and stir it in. Sesame oil rules, just don't use too much.</li>
        <li>And you're good to go! Plate your rice up and enjoy. :)</li>
    </ol>
